# Adding funds to wallet

### Step 1: Get some Ethereum (ETH)

Ether is used to pay for interactions on the block chain (known as gas).

You spend gas everytime you make a call to SingularityNET:

* Transfer AGIX into the multi-party escrow account,
* Create a payment channel for a service published in the SingularityNET registry, and
* Transfer AGIX into the payment channel and set the timeout

After that, you interact with the service directly and won’t need to pay for further transactions unless you want to add more AGIX or extend the timeout for the payment channel.

So how do you get Ether? The mainnet requires you to buy or mine it, but we’re going to use a test net for now. Specifically Sepolia.&#x20;

Luckily for test networks you can go to any [Sepolia-Ethereum](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia) faucet and get some, or reach out to somebody on the SingularityNET developer team through their [Mattermost channels](https://chat.singularitynet.io).&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">NOTE</mark>: If you attempt to pull from a faucet, you may be required to hold a tiny amount of main net Ethereum. This is in order to circumvent robots and scripters.&#x20;

### Step 2: Get some AGIX

Once you have created your default account, and added some ethereum to your wallet, you need to add some AGIX to your wallet.&#x20;

These are the tokens utilized for calling services on the marketplace. Please connect your MetaMask wallet to the [SingularityNET faucet](https://faucet.singularitynet.io/), and request some AGIX, or reach out to somebody on the SingularityNET developer team through their [Mattermost channels](https://chat.singularitynet.io).&#x20;
