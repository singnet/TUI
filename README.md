sNET VBRL TUI

NOTE: Requires python 3.7.x for interaction with CLI. Ideally you should clone this repo into the same environment you have installed the CLI in

Usage:
1) Ensure you have run the "install.sh" bash script first, if you have not already. This will set up your machine with environments, ETCD, CLI & Daemon
2) Install requirements with pip
3) Run TUI with "application/main.py" file
