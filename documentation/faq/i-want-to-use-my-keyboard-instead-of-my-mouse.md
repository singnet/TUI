# I want to use my keyboard instead of my mouse!

You would honestly be better off using the CLI directly if this is the case, the TUI would only serve to slow you down. However, this is a semi-supported option.&#x20;

You can move the "cursor" down the page with the `Tab` button, select things with the `Enter` button, and scroll the page/select between radio buttons with the `Arrow Keys`.
