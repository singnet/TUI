# Getting Started

Setting up the TUI is relatively simple with the provided run scripts. There just may be a few things you need to install beforehand:

## Requirements

The only base requirement for the TUI:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - _Allows you to clone the repository_

The rest of the requirements are automatically installed through the run script. Here is a list if you would prefer to install them manually:

* Universal
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.10
  * [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - _Python package manager_
  * [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - _Python virtual environment manager_
* **Linux**&#x20;
  * libudev (CLI requirement)
  * libusb 1.0 (CLI requirement)
* **MacOS**
  * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - _Package manager (only used to auto install python)_
* **Windows**
  * [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) - _Package manager (only used to auto install python)_



Once you've installed the necessary requirements, you can move on to installing/executing the TUI
